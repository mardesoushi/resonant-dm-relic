# About

On this repositories we put some of our calculation wich is described [on this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03680), namely _Investigation of spin-dependent dark matter in mono-photon production at high-energy colliders_.

Out analisys focused to find the total cross sections for Standar Model (SM) fermions anihiliating into dark matter (DM) final states, mediated by a heavy boson Z'. 

On our code, the three DM final states are referend by scalar (S), fermion (F) and vector (V) DM. 

Also, `ee` stands for electron positron colliders events and `qq` for proton-proton events for hadron colliders, with the aid of Parton Density Functions (PDF) from [LHAPDF](!https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/) package.

## Abstract (from which these calculations were used for)

Many theories about dark matter have emerged due to its strong theoretical appeal in explaining astrophysical phenomena. However, experimental and theoretical particle physics have yet not provided evidence that dark matter is part of the observable Universe. Our work aims to investigate the interaction between Standard Model (SM) fermions and different species of dark matter (DM) particles in high-energy collisions through interaction of a new massive vector mediator, Z'. The production of scalar and fermion DM pairs via fermion annihilation into the new vector boson is investigated near a resonance, where a SM signal from hard photon emission is considered as initial state radiation, namely a mono-photon production. Values of coupling constants between the DM and the SM particles are mapped in contrast to the Planck satellite data for thermal relic density DM computed in the correct framework for the relic density near a resonance, where a weaker suppression of the relic density is expected. We show for the CLIC and LHC kinematic regimes that certain mass ranges and coupling constants of these DM particles are in agreement with the expected relic density near a resonance and are not excluded by collider and astrophysical limits.
